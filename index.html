        <h3 class="bg">Biology</h3>
        <p class="bg">Alcremie is a vaguely anthropoid Pokémon with a body composed of whipped cream. Its head resembles several dollops of whipped cream styled like hair, with a large crowning dollop flanked by two loop-like "bangs." Each of these bangs is topped with either a strawberry, blueberries, clovers, or several varieties of candy, depending on which Sweet the Alcremie was given to hold as a Milcery when evolving. Alcremie's lower body is similarly composed of two dollops of whipped cream resembling a robe or a dress. It has two stout arms with three fingers each extending between the dollops of its body. Alcremie is a female-only species with no male counterpart.

          Alcremie's flavor and color are wildly variable and dependent on the time of day, direction, and duration for which it was swirled while it was a Milcery. An Alcremie's flavor affects the color of its body, which can be any of several pastel shades. Its eye color matches the color of its sweet.
          
          In its Gigantamax form, Alcremie's body resembles a towering, five-tiered cake. The apical tier of the cake resembles Alcremie's regular body, though it's wearing a bow and its whipped-cream "hair" is styled into a flamboyant swoop. Each of the bottom layers of the cake feature an assortment of the sweets that can be used to evolve Alcremie from Milcery. Three red clouds surround the fourth tier of its body. The first tier of its body is frosted yellow and adorned with an alternating row of star sweets and dotted frosting. The second tier is frosted pink and features a magenta frosting bow topped with a clover sweet. The third tier is frosted blue and encircled with a row of flower-shaped sweets. Additionally, it features an arch of blueberries. The fourth tier is also frosted pink and encircled with heart-shaped sweets, with the ventral candied heart being a little larger than the rest. Dollops of whipped cream encircle Gigantamax Alcremie's body between each of its tiers.</p>
